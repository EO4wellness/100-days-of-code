# Personal History 
* Discovered the #100DaysofCode challenge in December of 2019.  
* Decided to begin this coding challenge Jan 1, 2020.  
* While I've coded every day since Dec 2019 (even before beginning this challenge) I didn't get serious about coding until "round 1" in Dec of 2020. 
* I'm gaining in skills and seriousness of the coding experience ever since. 

## Lessons Learned
* When I began, I didn't consistently log, though I consistently coded. 
* Logging is now getting easier. 
* When I began I didn't know what a GitHub Heat Map was. 
* My "Heat Map" on GitHub was nonexistant when I started. 
* My GitHub "Heat Map" is more or less consistent since Round 1. 
* Likewise, my Heat Map on several other sites is now also consistent. see: [freeCodeCamp profile example](https://www.freecodecamp.org/fcc82f28646-b371-4d60-b44c-2a1e6e85fbd9) and [daily.dev profile](https://app.daily.dev/EO4Wellness)
* I'm not consistent with posting to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eo4wellness?lang=en).  I'm okay with that.  Not every platform conects with every one's time/interests. 
* Likewise, I haven't yet got into [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/15595310/eo4wellness) though I hear I likely will in a few more rounds of this daily coding...
