# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ## Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com) -->

#### Continued Building the _Recipe App_ 

**Today's Progress**: Built the very important - _Recipe View_ section of the _Recipe App_, rendered the API response to the UI with an additional feature of letting users change the number of servings to see real-time results on the UI.  

**Thoughts**: Almost finished building the app, just a few more sections left to work on. Felt very good indeed. Just can't believe I've taken up this challenge. Hope I can take this momentum forward without having to slip at any stage of the challenge. I'm really determined to go all the way. Welcome to my *#100DaysOfCode* journal.

**Sections to work:**  _Shopping List_ and _Likes Model_. 


## Day 2: November 19, Monday

#### Completed building the _Recipe App_

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the _Shopping List_ and _Likes_ section of the app, got them to work fine. Also implemented persistent data storage to remember the recipes liked by user irrespective of page reloads.  

**Thoughts** Finally I've completed building the _Recipe App_. I started this project way before taking up this challenge so that means I have to come up with a new project/task for the next few days of the challenge...eyes firmly set on FreeCodeCamp. Really looking forward to what lies on store.
