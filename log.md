# 100 Days Of Code - Log
Traditionally, the 100 Days of Code Project includes this daily log.  Rather than doing the daily log (though, I might do so in the future) for right now, because I'm learning all of the features, tips, and tricks of GIT and GITHUB (using the website interface, using CLP, using GitHubDesktop, etc) I wanted to do the "log" as a combination of these features to gain better familiarity and experience with each. So....for now, you will find that here: [Today I Learned Repo](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L)
