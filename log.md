# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ## Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

## Day 1: November 18, 2018

#### Continued Building the _Recipe App_ 

**Today's Progress**: Built the very important - _Recipe View_ section of the _Recipe App_, rendered the API response to the UI with an additional feature of letting users change the number of servings to see real-time results on the UI.  

**Thoughts**: Almost finished building the app, just a few more sections left to work on. Felt very good indeed. Just can't believe I've taken up this challenge. Hope I can take this momentum forward without having to slip at any stage of the challenge. I'm really determined to go all the way. Welcome to my *#100DaysOfCode* log.

**Sections to work:**  _Shopping List_ and _Likes Model_. 


<!-- ### Day 2: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
