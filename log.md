# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ## Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com) -->
### Year: 2018

## Day 1: November 18, Sunday

#### Continued Building the _Recipe App_ 

**Today's Progress**: Built the very important - _Recipe View_ section of the _Recipe App_, rendered the API response to the UI with an additional feature of letting users change the number of servings to see real-time results on the UI.  

**Thoughts**: Almost finished building the app, just a few more sections left to work on. Felt very good indeed. Just can't believe I've taken up this challenge. Hope I can take this momentum forward without having to slip at any stage of the challenge. I'm really determined to go all the way. Welcome to my *#100DaysOfCode* journal.

**Sections to work:**  _Shopping List_ and _Likes Model_. 


## Day 2: November 19, Monday

#### Completed building the _Recipe App_

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the _Shopping List_ and _Likes_ section of the app, got them to work fine. Also implemented persistent data storage to remember the recipes liked by user irrespective of page reloads.  

**Thoughts**: Finally I've completed building the _Recipe App_. I started this project way before taking up this challenge so that means I have to come up with a new project/task for the next few days of the challenge...eyes firmly set on FreeCodeCamp. Really looking forward to what lies on store. 

## Day 3: November 20, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Did some final corrections, cleaned up the code a bit before generating the build-version of the _Recipe App_ and deploying it. Also my portfolio website got a very quick update.

**Thoughts**: This day was focused more on deploying the _Recipe App_ and I should say it went quite well. Updating the portfolio site was much of a breeze. 

## Day 4: November 21, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up a couple of CSS sections on FreeCodeCamp.  

**Thoughts**: Refreshed a bit of CSS through FreeCodeCamp exercises. Couldn't do an awful lot today because of the semester exam tomorrow. 

## Day 5: November 22, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Did the Applied Visual Design, Applied Accessibility and Responsive Web Design Principles sections on FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: It's always great fun coding up these animations in CSS. Yet another day in which I couldn't spend a lot of time coding. A strong comeback is on the cards buddy. See ya tomorrow!  

## Day 6: November 23, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed all the _Responsive Web Design_ challenges on _FreeCodeCamp_ except the projects.

**Thoughts**: Yet another day where I only focused on FreeCodeCamp exercises but I think the all the fun starts tomorrrow when I start doing the projects. Also starting my _Machine Learning_ jouney tomorrow. Hoping for the best.

## Day 7: November 24, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started the Machine Learning journey. Learnt some basics about machine learning and linear regression.

**Thoughts**: Finaly learning what I've always wanted to but it doesn't seem so simple of a task but if it was simple I wouldn't be doing it. I hope this curiosity can steer me in the right way and help me get there, no matter what I'm not giving up.
