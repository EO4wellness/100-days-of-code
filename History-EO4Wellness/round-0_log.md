During the Udacity Tech Scholarship program with Bertlesmann for AI/Deep Learning, I discovered the 100 Days of Code challenge and began what I call "round zero" on Jan 1, 2020. 

Since then I've been coding and/or learning about coding every day since then and encouraging other coders on the various learning platforms in which I am learning.
