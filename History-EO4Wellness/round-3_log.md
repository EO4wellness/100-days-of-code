### Possible Future Round Ideas?
Potential Future projects realted to this freely-available-online ebook "Grokking Algorithms - An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people" for my next round (perhaps round 4) when I've concluded the other studies & projects which I'm currently working on... 

### Round History: 
* began what I call ROUND ZERO during the Bertlesmann Udacity Scholarship challenge. 
* [round zero](https://github.com/EO4wellness/100-days-of-code/blob/master/History-EO4Wellness/round-0_log.md) was daily git/github/markup/html practice for 100 days, plus my Udacity course work & studies. 
* [round one](https://github.com/EO4wellness/100-days-of-code/blob/master/History-EO4Wellness/round-1_log.md)
* [round two](https://github.com/EO4wellness/100-days-of-code/blob/master/History-EO4Wellness/round-2_log.md)
* [round three](https://github.com/EO4wellness/100-days-of-code/edit/master/History-EO4Wellness/round-3_log.md) (this page)
